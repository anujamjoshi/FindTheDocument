 * Room is the class that holds the document. Within the grid, they are merely mystery doors that will hold mostly nothing.
 * There will be 9 rooms set within the grid, with the possibility of one door holding the documents that the player must get to 
 * in order to win the game. This document is set in a random room in the grid, so the game is much more unpredictable.
