 * Enemy is the threat of the game. A player will mover throughout a grid like enviroment, in hopes of searching for
 * a document, however, the enemy is intended to prevent the player from reach his/her goals. The enemy is to move 
 * randomly in the grid, and search each adjacent tile for the player. If the player is next to the enemy, the enemy 
 * will stab the player, killing him/her, and sending him/her back to the starting point.
