/**
 * The Engine is what runs the actual statistics and calculations of the game. For this, the class also creates the grid that the game will 
 * be based on. The engine will also contain methods to manipulate the grid, based on how the user and the enemies move and if they are still
 * in the game or not. The engine specifies everything from creating the player, the enemies, the rooms, and the powerups, then placing them into the grid
 * for manipulation. This allows for the engine to do things that require the access to its grid, without the need to access them elsewhere. Engines are important 
 * to the design and implmentation of any program, as they are the classes that gather the information and manipulate them when needed.
