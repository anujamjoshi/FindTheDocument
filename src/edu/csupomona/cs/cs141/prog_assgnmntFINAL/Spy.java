/**
 * The spy class, or otherwise known as the player class, is the main protagonist of the game world, the hero 
 * that is to be controlled by the one who is going to play. The player is given certain advantages, that is 
 * to move one direction in any direction for his/her turn, to shoot and kill an enemy if he/she so desires, and to
 * check rooms for the documents to win the game overall. Of course, the player is given three lives to complete their goal, 
 * if an enemy was to kill the player, the player would lose a life and start back to square one. If they lose all lives, the game
 * is lost.
