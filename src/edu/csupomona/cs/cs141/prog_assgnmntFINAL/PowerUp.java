 * Power up class is set up to give the player the advantage of the game. Power ups allow the 
 * player to recieve one more bullet, become invincible, or to reveal the document for the player. Of course, the player
 * would need to find these power ups in the grid in order to recieve these advantages. These powerups are set randomly across 
 * the grid for the player to find.
